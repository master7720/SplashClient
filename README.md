# How-To-Use
The client has an some Chinese security system. First, retrieve the [server zip](https://github.com/master7720/SplashClient/tree/main/splash-server-master)' file, build and run it within an IDE. Then, launch the [splash.jar](https://github.com/master7720/SplashClient/tree/main/splash-server-master) in your launcher, ensuring that the 'server.zip' remains open in the IDE without being closed.(wtf)
